# Guyyatsu Hikikomori's Main Online Server
This space serves as the platform for presenting my main online server, `lab-93.guyyatsu.me`; which acts as the primary domain controller for my entire website.  Here we have code packages, configuration files, and any other myriad scripts the host is in posession of; it acts as both a backup and a test-bed for all of my code projects.

## [Main Site](https://guyyatsu.me)
As *primary domain controller*, Lab-93 acts as the central nexus point of `guyyatsu.me`; meaning the two are one and the same, _**however**_, `guyyatsu.me` reffers to the _user facing_ side of the domain and `Lab-93` reffers to the _developer facing_ side.  The difference is subtle, but there's a whole different aspect to how you enter the domain.
